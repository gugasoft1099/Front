# Public Assets Directory

This directory contains static assets like images.

## Current SVG Placeholders

The following SVG placeholder images are included for development:
- `hero.svg` - Hero section placeholder
- `p1.svg` through `p8.svg` - Product image placeholders

## Replacing Placeholders

To use real images:
1. Replace the SVG files with actual JPG/PNG images
2. Keep the same filenames (hero.jpg, p1.jpg, etc.) OR
3. Update the image paths in `lib/data.ts` and `app/page.tsx`

You can also use remote images from Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay (configured in next.config.js).
